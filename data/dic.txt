you

the
very
best
of
me
so
i
start
a
fight
cause
i
need
to
feel
something
and
you
do
what
you
want
cause
i
m
not
what
you
wanted
oh

a
rainy
ending
given
to
a
perfect
day
just
walk
away
no
use
defending
words
that
you
will
never
say
and
now
that
i
m
sitting
here
thinking
it
through
i
ve
never
been
anywhere
cold
as
you
you
put
up
walls
and
paint
them
all
a
shade
of
gray
and
i
stood
there
loving
you
and
wished
them
all
away
and
you
come
away
with
a
great
little
story
of
a
mess
of
a
dreamer
with
the
nerve
to
adore
you
oh
what
a
shame
what
a
rainy
ending
given
to
a
perfect
day
so
just
walk
away
no
use
defending
words
that
you
will
never
say
and
now
that
i
m
sitting
here
thinking
it
through
i
ve
never
been
anywhere
cold
as
you
you
never
did
give
a
damn
thing
honey
but
i
cried
cried
for
you
and
i
know
you
wouldn
t
have
told
nobody
if
i
died
died
for
you
died
for
you
oh
what
a
shame
what
a
rainy
ending
given
to
a
perfect
day
every
smile
you
fake
is
so
condescending
counting
all
the
scars
you
made
and
now
that
i
m
sitting
here
thinking
it
through
i
ve
never
been
anywhere
cold
as
youi
didn
t
know
what
i
would
find
when
i
went
looking
for
a
reason
i
know
i
didn
t
read
between
the
lines
and
baby
i
ve
got
nowhere
to
go
i
tried
to
take
the
road
less
traveled
by
but
nothing
seems
to
work
the
first
few
times
am
i
right
so
how
can
i
ever
try
to
be
better
nobody
ever
lets
me
in
i
can
still
see
you
this
ain
t
the
best
view
on
the
outside
looking
in
and
i
ve
been
a
lot
of
lonely
places
i
ve
never
been
on
the
outside
you
saw
me
there
but
never
knew
that
i
would
give
it
all
up
to
be
a
part
of
this
a
part
of
you
and
now
it
s
all
too
late
so
you
see
you
could
ve
helped
if
you
had
wanted
to
but
no
one
notices
until
it
s
too
late
to
do
anything
so
how
can
i
ever
try
to
be
better
nobody
ever
lets
me
in
i
can
still
see
you
this
ain
t
the
best
view
on
the
outside
looking
in
and
i
ve
been
a
lot
of
lonely
places
i
ve
never
been
on
the
outside
oh
yeah
so
how
can
i
ever
try
to
be
better
nobody
ever
lets
me
in
and
i
can
still
see
you
this
ain
t
the
best
view
on
the
outside
looking
in
and
i
ve
been
a
lot
of
lonely
places
i
ve
never
been
on
the
outsideseems
the
only
one
who
doesn
t
see
your
beauty
is
the
face
in
the
mirror
looking
back
at
you
you
walk
around
here
thinking
you
re
not
pretty
but
that
s
not
true
cause
i
know
you
hold
on
baby
you
re
losing
it
the
water
s
high
you
re
jumping
into
it
and
letting
go
and
no
one
knows
that
you
cry
but
you
don
t
tell
anyone
that
you
might
not
be
the
golden
one
and
you
re
tied
together
with
a
smile
but
you
re
coming
undone
i
guess
it
s
true
that
love
was
all
you
wanted
cause
you
re
giving
it
away
like
it
s
extra
change
hoping
it
will
end
up
in
his
pocket
but
he
leaves
you
out
like
a
penny
in
the
rain
oh
cause
it
s
not
his
price
to
pay
it
s
not
his
price
to
pay
hold
on
baby
you
re
losing
it
the
water
s
high
you
re
jumping
into
it
and
letting
go
and
no
one
knows
that
you
cry
but
you
don
t
tell
anyone
that
you
might
not
be
the
golden
one
and
you
re
tied
together
with
a
smile
but
you
re
coming
undone
hold
on
baby
you
re
losing
it
the
water
s
high
you
re
jumping

and
no

you
don

and
you

hard
to

listening
to

kind
of

short
skirts
i

on

been
here
the
whole
time

with
me
you
belong
with
me
walk
in
the
streets
with
you
in
your
worn
out
jeans

how
it

to
be
laughing
on
a
park
bench
thinking
to
myself
hey

this
easy
and
you

got
a
smile
that
could
light
up
this
whole
town

in
a
while
since
she
brought
you
down
you
say
you

than

girl
like
that
she
wears
high
heels
i
wear
sneakers
she
s
cheer
captain
and
i
m
on
the
bleachers
dreaming
about
the
day
when
you
wake
up
and
find
that
what
you
re
looking
for
has
been
here
the
whole
time
if
you
could
see
that
i
m
the
one
who
understands
you
been
here
all
along
so
why

t
you

by
and
waiting
at
your
backdoor

this
time
how

you

your
family
i
haven
t
seen
them
in
a
while
you
ve
been
good
busier
than
ever
we
small
talk
work
and
the
weather
your
guard
is
up
and
i
know
why
because
the
last
time
you
saw
me
is
still
burned
in
the
back
of
your
mind
you
gave
me
roses
and
i
left
them
there
to
die
so
this
is
me
swallowing
my
pride
standing
in
front
of
you
saying
i
m
sorry
for
that
night
and
i
go
back
to
december
all
the
time
it
turns
out
freedom
ain
t
nothing
but
missing
you
wishing
i
d
realized
what
i
had
when
you
were
mine
i
d
go
back
to
december
turn
around
and
make
it
all
right
i
go
back
to
december
all
the
time
these
days
i
haven
t
been
sleeping
staying
up
playing
back
myself
leavin
when
your
birthday
passed
and
i
didn
t
call
and
i
think
about
summer
all
the
beautiful
times
i
watched
you
laughing
from
the
passenger
side
and
realized
i
loved
you
in
the
fall
and
then
the
cold
came
the
dark
days
when
fear
crept
into
my
mind
you
gave
me
all
your
love
and
all
i
gave
you
was
goodbye
so
this
is
me
swallowing
my
pride
standing
in
front
of
you
saying
i
m
sorry
for
that
night
and
i
go
back
to
december
all
the
time
it
turns
out
freedom
ain
t
nothing
but
missing
you
wishing
i
d
realized
what
i
had
when
you
were
mine
i
d
go
back
to
december
turn
around
and
change
my
own
mind
i
go
back
to
december
all
the
time
i
miss
your
tanned
skin
your
sweet
smile
so
good
to
me
so
right
and
how
you
held
me
in
your
arms
that
september
night
the
first
time
you
ever
saw
me
cry
maybe
this
is
wishful
thinking
probably
mindless
dreaming
but
if
we
loved
again
i
swear
i
d
love
you
right
i
d
go
back
in
time
and
change
it
but
i
can
t
so
if
the
chain
is
on
your
door
i
understand
but
this
is
me
swallowing
my
pride
standing
in
front
of
you
saying
i
m
sorry
for
that
night
and
i
go
back
to
december
it
turns
out
freedom
ain

nothing
but
missing
you
wishing

what
i
had
when
you
were
mine
i
d
go
back
to
december
turn
around
and
make
it
all
right
i
d
go
back
to
december
turn
around
and
change
my
own
mind
i
go
back
to
december
all
the
time
all
the
time
i
am
not
the
kind
of
girl
who
should
be
rudely
barging
in
on
a
white
veil
occasion
but
you
are
not
the
kind
of
boy
who
should
be
marrying
the
wrong
girl
i
sneak
in
and
see
your
friends
and
her
snotty
little
family
all
dressed
in
pastel
and
she
is
yelling
at
a
bridesmaid
somewhere
back
inside
a
room
wearing
a
gown
shaped
like
a
pastry
this
is
surely
not
what
you
thought
it
would
be
i
lose
myself
in
a
daydream
where
i
stand
and
say
don
t
say
yes
run
away
now
i
ll
meet
you
when
you
re
out
of
the
church
at
the
back
door
don
t
wait
or
say
a
single
vow
you
need
to
hear
me
out
and
they
said
speak
now
fond
gestures
are
exchanged
and
the
organ
starts
to
play
a
song
that
sounds
like
a
death
march
and
i
am
hiding
in
the
curtains
it
seems
that
i
was
uninvited
by
your
lovely
bride
to
be
she
floats
down
the
aisle
like
a
pageant
queen
but
i
know
you
wish
it
was
me
you
wish
it
was
me
don
t
you
don
t
say
yes
run
away
now

out
and
they

a
single
vow
i
hear
the
preacher
say
speak
now
or
forever
hold
your
peace
there
s
the
silence
there
s
my
last
chance
i
stand
up
with
shaky
hands
all
eyes
on
me
horrified
looks
from
everyone
in
the
room
but
i
m
only
looking
at
you
i
am
not
the
kind
of
girl
who
should
be
rudely
barging
in
on
a
white
veil
occasion
but

out
of
my
tux
at
the
back
door

didn
t
say
my
vows
so
glad
you
were
around
when
they
said
speak
now
long
were
the
nights
when
my
days
once
revolved
around
you
counting
my
footsteps
praying
the
floor
won
t
fall
through
again
and
my
mother
accused
me
of
losing
my
mind
but
i
swore
i
was
fine
you
paint
me
a
blue
sky
and
go
back
and
turn
it
to
rain
and
i
lived
in
your
chess
game
but
you
changed
the
rules
every
day
wonderin
which
version
of
you
i
might
get
on
the
phone
tonight
well
i
stopped
pickin
up
and
this
song
is
to
let
you
know
why
dear
john
i
see
it
all
now
that
you
re
gone
don
t
you
think
i

too
young
to
be
messed
with
the
girl
in
the
dress
cried
the
whole
way
home
i
should
ve
known
well
maybe
it
s
me
and
my
blind
optimism
to
blame
or
maybe
it
s
you
and
your
sick
need
to
give
love
then
take
it
away
and
you
ll
add
my
name
to
your
long
list
of
traitors
who
don
t
understand
and
i
look
back
in
regret
how
i
ignored
when
they
said
run
as
fast
as
you
can
dear
john
i
see
it
all
now
that
you

gone

acing
your
tests
all
the
girls
that

tired
lifeless
eyes
cause

burned
them
out
but

your
matches
before

could
catch
me
so

i
used
to
think
one
day
we
d
tell
the
story
of
us
how
we
met
and
the
sparks
flew
instantly
and
people
would
say
they
re
the
lucky
ones
i
used
to
know
my
place
was
the
spot
next
to
you
now
i
m
searching
the
room
for
an
empty
seat
cause
lately
i
don
t
even
know
what
page
you
re
on
oh
a
simple
complication
miscommunications
lead
to
fall
out
so
many
things
that
i
wish
you
knew
so
many
walls
up
i
can
t
break
through
now
i
m
standing
alone
in
a
crowded
room
and
we
re
not
speaking
and
i
m
dying
to
know
is
it
killing
you
like
it
s
killing
me
yeah
i
don
t
know
what
to
say
since
the
twist
of
fate
when
it
all
broke
down
and
the
story
of
us
looks
a
lot
like
a
tragedy
now

d
we
end
up
this
way
see
me
nervously
pulling
at
my
clothes
and
trying
to
look
busy
and
you
re
doing
your
best
to
avoid
me
i
m
starting
to
think
one
day
i
ll
tell
the
story
of
us
how
i
was
losing
my
mind
when
i
saw
you
here
but
you
held
your
pride
like

should
ve
held
me

is
nothing

liked
it
better
when

on
my

old
tired
lonely
place
walls
of
insincerity
shifting
eyes
and
vacancy
vanished

your
face

i
can
say
is
it
was
enchanting
to
meet
you
your
eyes
whispered
have
we
met
across
the
room
your
silhouette
starts
to
make
its
way
to
me
the
playful
conversation
starts
counter
all
your
quick
remarks
like
passing
notes
in
secrecy
and
it
was
enchanting
to
meet
you

i
can
say
is

first
page

where
the
story
line
ends

thoughts
will
echo
your
name
until
i

you

are
the
words
i
held
back
as

please
don
t
have
somebody
waiting
on
younow
go
stand
in
the
corner
and
think
about
what
you
did
time
for
a
little
revenge
the
story
starts
when
it
was
hot
and
it
was
summer
and
i
had
it
all
i
had
him
right
there
where
i
wanted
him
she
came
along
got
him
alone
and
let
s
hear
the
applause
she
took
him
faster
than
you
could
say
sabotage
i
never
saw
it
coming
wouldn
t
have
suspected
it
i
underestimated
just
who
i
was
dealing
with
she
had
to
know
the
pain
was
beating
on
me
like
a
drum
she
underestimated
just
who
she
was
stealing
from
she
s
not
a
saint
and
she
s
not
what
you
think
she
s
an
actress
she
s
better
known
for
the
things
that
she
does
on
the
mattress
soon
she
s
gonna
find
stealing
other
people
s
toys
on
the
playground
won
t
make
you
many
friends
she
should
keep
in
mind
she
should
keep
in
mind
there
is
nothing
i
do
better
than
revenge
she
looks
at
life
like
it
s
a
party
and
she
s
on
the
list
she
looks
at
me
like
i
m
a
trend
and
she
s
so
over
it
i
think
her
ever
present
frown
is
a
little
troubling
she
thinks
i
m
psycho
cause
i
like
to
rhyme
her
name
with
things
but
sophistication
isn
t
what
you
wear
or
who
you
know
or
pushing
people
down
to
get
you
where
you
wanna
go
they
wouldn
t
teach
you
that
in
prep
school
so
it
s
up
to
me
but
no
amount
of
vintage
dresses
gives
you
dignity
she
s
not
a
saint
and
she
s
not
what
you
think
she
s
an
actress
she
s
better
known
for
the
things
that
she
does
on
the
mattress
soon
she
s
gonna
find
stealing
other
people
s
toys
on
the
playground
won
t
make
you
many
friends
she
should
keep
in
mind
she
should
keep
in
mind
there
is
nothing
i
do
better
than
revenge
i
m
just
another
thing
for
you
to
roll
your
eyes
at
honey
you
might
have
him
but
haven
t
you
heard
i
m
just
another
thing
for
you
to
roll
your
eyes
at
honey
you
might
have
him
but
i
always
get
the
last
word
she
s
not
a
saint
and
she
s
not
what
you
think
she
s
an
actress
she
deserve
it
she
s
better
known
for
the
things
that
she
does
on
the
mattress
soon
she
s
gonna
find
stealing
other
people

deserve
some
applause

she
took
him

you
could
say

really
did
it

your
warpath

floor
wearing
your

is
i
don
t
know
how
to
be
something

we
d
have
a
last
kiss
never
imagined
we
d
end
like
this
your
name
forever
the
name
on
my
lips
i
do
remember
the
swing
of
your
step
the
life
of
the
party
you
re
showing
off
again
and
i
roll
my
eyes
and
then
you
pull
me
in
i
m
not
much
for
dancing
but
for
you
i
did
because
i
love
your
handshake
meeting
my
father
i
love
how
you
walk
with
your
hands
in
your
pockets
how
you
kissed
me
when
i
was
in
the
middle
of
saying
something
there
s
not
a
day
i
don
t
miss
those
rude
interruptions
and
i
ll
go
sit
on
the
floor
wearing
your
clothes
all
that
i
know
is
i
don
t
know
how
to
be
something
you
miss
never
thought
we
d
have
a
last
kiss
never
imagined
we
d
end
like
this
your
name
forever
the
name
on
my
lips
so
i
ll
watch
your
life
in
pictures
like
i
used
to
watch
you
sleep
and
i
feel
you
forget
me
like
i
used
to
feel
you
breathe
and
i
keep
up
with
our
old
friends
just
to
ask
them
how
you
are
hope
it
s
nice
where
you
are
and
i
hope
the
sun
shines
and
it
s
a
beautiful
day
and
something
reminds
you
you
wish
you
had
stayed
you
can
plan
for
a
change
in
weather
and
time
but
i
never
planned
on
you
changing
your
mind
so
i
ll
go
sit
on
the
floor
wearing
your
clothes
all
that
i
know
is
i
don
t
know
how
to
be
something
you
miss
never
thought
we
d
have
a
last
kiss
never
imagined
we
d
end
like
this
your
name
forever
the
name
on
my
lips
just
like
our
last
kiss
forever
the
name
on
my
lips
forever
the
name
on
my
lips
just
like
our
last
i
said
remember
this
moment
in
the
back
of
my
mind
the
time
we
stood
with
our
shaking
hands
the
crowds
in
stands
went
wild
we
were
the
kings
and
the
queens
and
they
read
off
our
names
the
night
you
danced
like
you
knew
our
lives
would
never
be
the
same
you
held
your
head
like
a
hero
on
a
history
book
page
it
was
the
end
of
a
decade
but
the
start
of
an
age
long
live
the
walls
we
crashed
through
how
the
kingdom
lights
shined
just
for
me
and
you
i
was
screaming
long
live
all
the
magic
we
made
and
bring
on
all
the
pretenders
one
day
we
will
be
remembered
i
said
remember
this
feeling
i
pass
the
pictures
around
of
all
the
years
that
we
stood
there
on
the
side
lines
wishing
for
right
now
we
are
the
kings
and
the
queens
you
traded
your
baseball
cap
for
a
crown
when
they
gave
us
our
trophies
and
we
held
them
up
for
our
town
and
the
cynics
were
outraged
screaming
this
is
absurd
cause
for
a
moment
a
band
of
thieves
in
ripped
up
jeans
got
to
rule
the
world
long
live
the
walls
we
crashed
through
how
the
kingdom
lights
shined
just
for
me
and
you
i
was
screaming
long
live
all
the
magic
we
made
and
bring
on
all
the
pretenders
i
m
not
afraid
long
live
all
the
mountains
we
moved
i
had
the
time
of
my
life
fighting
dragons
with
you
i
was
screaming
long
live
that
look
on
your
face
and
bring
on
all
the
pretenders
one
day
we
will
be
remembered
hold
on
to
spinning
around
confetti
falls
to
the
ground
may
these
memories
break
our
fall
will
you
take
a
moment
promise
me
this
that
you
ll
stand
by
me
forever
but
if
god
forbid
fate
should
step
in
and
force
us
into
a
goodbye
if
you
have
children
some
day
when
they
point
to
the
pictures
please
tell
them
my
name
tell
them
how
the
crowds
went
wild
tell
them
how
i
hope
they
shine
long
live
the
walls
we
crashed
through
i
had
the
time
of
my
life
with
you
long
long
live
the
walls
we
crashed
through
how
the
kingdom
lights
shined
just
for
me
and
you
and
i
was
screaming
long
live
all
the
magic
we
made
and
bring
on
all

i
m
not

that

and

one
day
we
will
be
rememberedelevator
buttons
and
morning
air
strangers
silence
makes
me
wanna
take
the
stairs
if
you
were
here
we
d
laugh
about
their
vacant
stares
but
right
now
my
time
is
theirs
seems
like
there
s
always
someone
who
disapproves
they
ll
judge
it
like
they
know
about
me
and
you
and
the
verdict
comes
from
those
with
nothing
else
to
do
the
jury
s
out
but
my
choice
is
you
so
don
t
you
worry
your
pretty
little
mind
people
throw
rocks
at
things
that
shine
and
life
makes
love
look
hard
the
stakes
are
high
the
water
s
rough
but
this
love
is
ours
you
never
know
what
people
have
up
their
sleeves
ghosts
from
your
past
gonna
jump
out
at
me
lurking
in
the
shadows
with
their
lip
gloss
smiles
but
i
don
t
care
cause
right
now
you
re
mine
and
you
ll
say
don
t
you
worry
your
pretty
little
mind
people
throw
rocks
at
things
that
shine
and
life
makes
love
look
hard
the
stakes
are
high
the
water
s
rough
but
this
love
is
ours
and
it
s
not
theirs
to
speculate
if
it
s
wrong
and
your
hands
are
tough
but
they
are
where
mine
belong
and
i
ll
fight
their
doubt
and
give
you
faith
with
this
song
for
you
cause
i
love
the
gap
between
your
teeth
and
i
love
the
riddles
that
you
speak
and
any
snide
remarks
from
my
father
about
your
tattoos
will
be
ignored
cause
my
heart
is
yours
so
don
t
you
worry
your
pretty
little
mind
people
throw
rocks
at
things
that
shine
and
life
makes
love
look
hard
don
t
you
worry
your
pretty
little
mind
people
throw
rocks
at
things
that
shine
but
they
can
t
take
what
s
ours
they
can
t
take
what
s
ours
the
stakes
are
high
the
water
s
rough
but
this
love
is
ourslast

fire
signs
four
blue
eyes

him
is
like
driving
a
new
maserati
down
a
dead
end
street
faster
than
the
wind
passionate
as
sin
ending
so
suddenly
loving
him
is
like
trying
to
change
your
mind
once
you
re
already
flying
through
the
free
fall
like
the
colors
in
autumn
so
bright
just
before
they
lose
it
all
losing
him
was
blue
like
i
d
never
known
missing
him
was
dark
grey
all
alone
forgetting
him
was
like
trying
to
know
somebody
you
never
met
but
loving
him
was
red

him
was
red
touching
him
was
like
realizing
all
you
ever
wanted
was
right
there
in
front
of
you
memorizing
him
was
as
easy
as
knowing
all
the
words
to
your
old
favorite
song
fighting
with
him
was
like
trying
to
solve
a
crossword
and
realizing
there
s
no
right
answer
regretting
him
was
like
wishing
you
never
found
out
that
love
could
be
that
strong
losing
him
was
blue
like
i
d
never
known
missing
him
was
dark
grey
all
alone
forgetting
him
was
like
trying
to
know
somebody
you
never
met
but
loving
him
was
red
oh
red
burning
red
remembering
him
comes
in
flashbacks
and
echoes
tell
myself
it
s
time
now
gotta
let
go
but
moving
on
from
him
is
impossible
when
i
still
see
it
all
in
my
head
in
burning
red
burning
it
was
red
oh
losing
him
was
blue
like
i
d
never
known
missing
him
was
dark
grey
all
alone
forgetting
him
was
like
trying
to
know
somebody
you
never
met
cause
loving
him
was
red
yeah

red
we
re
burning
red
and
that
s
why
he
s
spinnin
round
in
my
head

back
to
me
burning
red
yeah
yeah
his
love
was
like
driving
a
new
maserati
down
a
dead
end
streetput
your
lips
close
to
mine
as
long
as
they
don
t
touch
out
of
focus
eye
to
eye
till
the
gravity
s
too
much
and
i
ll
do
anything
you
say
if
you
say
it
with
your
hands
and
i
d
be
smart
to
walk
away
but
you
re
quicksand
this
slope
is
treacherous
this
path
is
reckless
this
slope
is
treacherous
and
i
i
i
like
it
i
can
t
decide
if
it
s
a
choice
getting
swept
away
i
hear
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
asking
you
to
stay
and
all
we
are
is
skin
and
bone
trained
to
get
along
forever
going
with
the
flow
but
you
re
friction
this
slope
is
treacherous
this
path
is
reckless
this
slope
is
treacherous
i
i
i
like
it
two
headlights
shine
through
the
sleepless
night
and
i
will
get
you
a
get
you
alone
your
name
has
echoed
through
my
mind
and
i
just
think
you
should
think
you
should
know
that
nothing
safe
is
worth
the
drive
and
i
would
follow
you
follow
you
home
i
ll
follow
you
follow
you
home
this
hope
is
treacherous
this
daydream
is

like
home
somehow
and
i

my
scarf
there
at
your
sister
s
house
and
you
ve
still
got
it
in
your
drawer
even
now
oh
your
sweet
disposition
and
my
wide
eyed
gaze
we
re
singing
in
the
car
getting
lost
upstate
autumn
leaves
falling
down
like
pieces
into
place
and
i
can
picture
it
after
all
these
days
and
i
know
it
s
long
gone
and
that
magic
s
not
here
no
more
and
i
might
be
okay
but
i
m
not
fine
at
all
cause
there
we
are
again
on
that
little
town
street
you
almost
ran
the
red
cause
you
were
looking
over
at
me
wind
in
my
hair
i
was
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
photo
album
on
the
counter
your
cheeks
were
turning
red
you
used
to
be
a
little
kid
with
glasses
in
a
twin
sized
bed
and
your
mother
s
telling
stories
about
you
on
a
tee
ball
team
you
taught
me
bout
your
past
thinking
your
future
was
me
and
i
know
it
s
long
gone
and
there
was
nothing
else
i
could
do
and
i
forget
about
you
long
enough
to
forget
why
i
needed
to
cause
there
we
are
again
in
the
middle
of
the
night
we
re
dancing
around
the
kitchen
in
the
refrigerator
light
down
the
stairs
i
was
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
yeah
well
maybe
we
got
lost
in
translation
maybe
i
asked
for
too
much
but
maybe
this
thing
was
a
masterpiece
til
you
tore
it
all
up
running
scared
i
was
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
hey
you
call
me
up
again
just
to
break
me
like
a
promise
so
casually
cruel
in
the
name
of
being
honest
i
m
a
crumpled
up
piece
of
paper
lying
here
cause
i
remember
it
all
all
all
too
well
time
won
t
fly
it
s
like
i
m
paralyzed
by
it
i
d
like
to
be
my
old
self
again
but
i
m
still
trying
to
find
it
after
plaid
shirt
days
and
nights
when
you
made
me
your
own
now
you
mail
back
my
things
and
i
walk
home
alone
but
you
keep
my
old
scarf
from
that
very
first
week
cause
it
reminds
you
of
innocence
and
it
smells
like
me
you
can
t
get
rid
of
it
cause
you
remember
it
all
too
well
yeah
cause
there
we
are
again
when
i
loved
you
so
back
before
you
lost
the
one
real
thing
you
ve
ever
known
it
was
rare
i
was
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
wind
in
my
hair

were
there

it
all
down
the
stairs

were
there

m
aching
no
past
nowhere
to
hide
just
you

day
while

coffee
all
alone
and
lord
it
took
me
away
back
to
a
first
glance
feeling
on
new
york
time
back
when
you
fit
in
my
poems
like
a
perfect
rhyme
took
off
faster
than
a
green
light
go
yeah
you
skipped
the
conversation
when
you
already
know
i
left
a
note
on
the
door
with
a
joke
we
d
made
and
that
was
the
first
day
and
darling
it
was
good
never
looking
down
and
right
there
where
we
stood
was
holy
ground
spinning
like
a
girl
in
a
brand
new
dress
we
had
this
big
wide
city
all
to
ourselves
we
blocked
the
noise
with
the
sound
of
i
need
you
and
for
the
first
time
i
had
something
to
lose
and
i
guess
we
fell
apart
in
the
usual
way
and
the
story
s
got
dust
on
every
page
but
sometimes
i
wonder
how
you
think
about
it
now
and
i
see
your
face
in
every
crowd
cause

was
good
never
looking
down
and
right
there

start
to
talk
about

burst
through
the
door
with
that
baby
i

right
here
smile
and
it
would
ve
felt
like
a
million
little
shining
stars
had
just
aligned
and
i
would
ve
been
so
happy
christmas
lights
glisten
i
ve
got
my
eye
on
the
door
just
waiting
for
you
to
walk
in
but
the
time
is
ticking
people
ask
me
how
i
ve
been
as
i
comb
back
through
my
memory
how
you
said
you
d
be
here
you
said
you
d
be
here
and
it
was
like
slow
motion
standing
there
in
my
party
dress
in
red
lipstick
with
no
one
to
impress
and
they
re
all
laughing
as
i
m
looking
around
the
room
but
there
s
one
thing
missing
and
that
was
the
moment
i
knew
and
the
hours
pass
by
now
i
just
wanna
be
alone
but
your
close
friends
always
seem
to
know
when
there
s
something
really
wrong
so
they
follow
me
down
the
hall
and
there
in
the
bathroom
i
try
not
to
fall
apart
and
the
sinking
feeling
starts
as
i
say
hopelessly
he
said
he
d
be
here
and
it
was
like
slow
motion
standing
there
in
my
party
dress
in
red
lipstick
with
no
one
to
impress
and
they
re
all
laughing
and
asking
me
about
you
but
there
was
one
thing
missing
and
that
was
the
moment
i
knew
what
do
you
say
when
tears
are
streaming
down
your
face
in
front
of
everyone
you
know
and
what
do
you
do
when
the
one
who
means
the
most
to
you
is
the
one
who
didn
t
show
you
should
ve
been
here
and
i
would
ve
been
so
happy
and
it
was
like
slow
motion
standing
there
in
my
party
dress
in
red
lipstick
with
no
one
to
impress
and
they
re
all
standing
around
me
singing
happy
birthday
to
you
but
there
was
one
thing
missing
and
that
was
the
moment
i
knew
ooh

called
me
later
and
said
i
m
sorry
i
didn
t
make
it
and

said

and
that
was
the
moment
i
knew
you

it
in
a
simple
way
4
am
the
second
day
how
strange
that
i
don
t
know

through
the
long
goodbye
one
last
kiss
then
catch
your
flight
right
when
i
was
just
about
to
fall
i
told
myself
don
t
get
attached
but
in
my
mind
i
play
it
back
spinning
faster
than
the
plane
that
took
you
and
this
is
when
the
feeling
sinks
in
i
don
t
wanna
miss
you
like
this

at
all
and
now
that
i
can
t
put
this
down
if
i
had
known
what

d
known

i
never
would
have
played
so
nonchalant
taxi
cabs
and
busy
streets
that
never
bring
you
back
to
me
i
can
t
help
but
wish
you
took
me
with
you
and

is
when

in

the
very
best
of
me
so
i
start
a
fight
cause
i
need
to
feel
something
and
you
do
what
you
want
cause
i
m
not
what
you
wanted

rainy
ending
given
to
a
perfect
day
just
walk
away
no
use
defending
words
that
you
will
never
say
and
now
that
i
m
sitting
here
thinking
it
through
i
ve
never
been
anywhere
cold
as
you
you
put
up
walls
and
paint
them
all
a
shade
of
gray
and
i
stood
there
loving
you
and
wished
them
all
away
and
you
come
away
with
a
great
little
story
of
a
mess
of
a
dreamer
with
the
nerve
to
adore
you
oh
what
a
shame
what
a
rainy
ending
given
to
a
perfect
day
so
just
walk
away
no
use
defending
words
that
you
will
never
say
and
now
that
i
m
sitting
here
thinking
it
through
i
ve
never
been
anywhere
cold
as
you
you
never
did
give
a
damn
thing
honey
but
i
cried
cried
for
you
and
i
know
you
wouldn
t
have
told
nobody
if
i
died
died
for
you
died
for
you
oh
what
a
shame
what
a
rainy
ending
given
to
a
perfect
day
every
smile
you
fake
is
so
condescending
counting
all
the
scars
you
made
and
now
that
i
m
sitting
here
thinking
it
through
i
ve
never
been
anywhere
cold
as
youi
didn
t
know
what
i
would
find
when
i
went
looking
for
a
reason
i
know
i
didn
t
read
between
the
lines
and
baby
i
ve
got
nowhere
to
go
i
tried
to
take
the
road
less
traveled
by
but
nothing
seems
to
work
the
first
few
times
am
i
right
so
how
can
i
ever
try
to
be
better
nobody
ever
lets
me
in
i
can
still
see
you
this
ain
t
the
best
view
on
the
outside
looking
in
and
i
ve
been
a
lot
of
lonely
places
i
ve
never
been
on
the
outside
you
saw
me
there
but
never
knew
that
i
would
give
it
all
up
to
be
a
part
of
this
a
part
of
you
and
now
it
s
all
too
late
so
you
see
you
could
ve
helped
if
you
had
wanted
to
but
no
one
notices
until
it
s
too
late
to
do
anything
so
how
can
i
ever
try
to
be
better
nobody
ever
lets
me
in
i
can
still
see
you
this
ain
t
the
best
view
on
the
outside
looking
in
and
i
ve
been
a
lot
of
lonely
places
i
ve
never
been
on
the
outside
oh
yeah
so
how
can
i
ever
try
to
be
better
nobody
ever
lets
me
in
and
i
can
still
see
you
this
ain
t
the
best
view
on
the
outside
looking
in
and
i
ve
been
a
lot
of
lonely
places
i
ve
never
been
on
the
outsideseems
the
only
one
who
doesn
t
see
your
beauty
is
the
face
in
the
mirror
looking
back
at
you
you
walk
around
here
thinking
you

but
that
s
not

one
and
you

tied
together
with
a
smile
but
you

true
that

was
all
you
wanted
cause
you
re
giving
it
away
like
it
s
extra
change
hoping
it
will
end
up
in
his
pocket
but
he
leaves
you
out
like
a
penny
in
the
rain
oh
cause
it
s
not
his
price
to
pay
it
s
not
his
price
to
pay
hold
on
baby
you
re
losing
it

in
the
streets
with

you
down
you

cheer
captain
and
i
m
on
the
bleachers
dreaming
about
the
day
when
you
wake
up
and
find
that
what
you
re
looking
for
has
been
here
the
whole
time
if
you
could
see
that
i
m
the
one

family
i

t
seen
them
in
a
while
you
ve
been
good
busier
than
ever
we
small
talk
work
and
the
weather
your
guard
is
up
and
i
know
why
because
the
last
time
you
saw
me
is
still
burned
in
the
back
of
your
mind
you
gave
me
roses
and
i
left
them
there
to
die
so
this
is
me
swallowing
my
pride
standing
in
front
of
you
saying
i
m
sorry
for
that
night
and
i
go
back
to
december
all
the
time
it
turns
out
freedom
ain
t
nothing
but
missing
you
wishing
i
d
realized
what
i
had
when
you
were
mine
i
d
go
back
to
december
turn
around
and
make
it
all
right
i
go
back
to
december
all
the
time
these
days
i
haven
t
been
sleeping
staying
up
playing
back
myself
leavin
when
your
birthday
passed
and
i
didn
t
call
and
i
think
about
summer
all
the
beautiful
times
i
watched
you
laughing
from
the
passenger
side
and
realized
i
loved
you
in
the
fall
and
then
the
cold
came
the
dark
days
when
fear
crept
into
my
mind
you
gave
me
all
your
love
and
all
i
gave
you
was
goodbye
so
this
is
me
swallowing
my
pride
standing
in
front
of
you
saying
i
m
sorry
for
that
night
and
i
go
back
to
december
all
the
time
it
turns
out
freedom
ain
t
nothing
but
missing
you
wishing
i
d
realized
what
i
had
when
you
were
mine
i
d
go
back
to
december
turn
around
and
change
my
own
mind
i
go
back
to
december
all
the
time
i
miss
your
tanned
skin
your
sweet
smile
so
good
to
me
so
right
and
how
you
held
me
in
your
arms
that
september
night
the
first
time
you
ever
saw
me
cry
maybe
this
is
wishful
thinking
probably
mindless
dreaming
but
if
we
loved
again
i
swear
i
d
love
you
right
i
d
go
back
in
time
and
change
it
but
i
can
t
so
if
the
chain
is
on
your
door
i
understand
but
this
is
me
swallowing
my
pride
standing
in
front
of
you
saying
i
m
sorry
for
that
night
and
i
go
back
to
december
it

had
when

i

to
december
turn
around
and
make
it
all
right
i
d
go
back
to
december
turn
around
and
change
my
own
mind
i
go
back
to
december
all
the
time
all
the
time
i
am
not
the
kind
of
girl
who
should
be
rudely
barging
in
on
a
white
veil
occasion
but
you
are
not
the
kind
of
boy
who
should
be
marrying
the
wrong
girl
i
sneak
in
and
see
your
friends
and
her
snotty
little
family
all
dressed
in
pastel
and
she
is
yelling
at
a
bridesmaid
somewhere
back
inside
a
room
wearing
a
gown
shaped
like
a
pastry
this
is
surely
not
what
you
thought
it
would
be
i
lose
myself
in
a
daydream
where
i
stand
and
say
don
t
say
yes
run
away
now
i
ll
meet
you
when
you
re
out
of
the
church
at
the
back
door
don
t
wait
or
say
a
single
vow
you
need
to
hear
me
out
and
they
said
speak
now
fond
gestures
are
exchanged
and
the
organ
starts
to
play
a
song
that
sounds
like
a
death
march
and
i
am
hiding
in
the
curtains
it
seems
that
i
was
uninvited
by
your
lovely
bride
to
be
she
floats
down
the
aisle
like
a
pageant
queen
but
i
know
you
wish
it
was
me
you
wish
it
was
me
don
t
you
don
t
say
yes
run
away
now
i
ll
meet
you

out
and
they

a
single
vow
i
hear
the
preacher
say
speak
now
or
forever
hold
your
peace
there
s
the
silence
there
s
my
last
chance
i
stand
up
with
shaky
hands
all
eyes
on
me
horrified
looks
from
everyone
in
the
room
but
i
m
only
looking
at
you
i
am
not
the
kind
of
girl
who
should
be
rudely
barging
in
on
a
white
veil
occasion
but
you
are
not
the
kind
of
boy

meet
you
when
i
m
out
of
my
tux
at
the
back
door
baby
i
didn
t
say
my
vows
so
glad
you
were
around
when
they
said
speak
now
long
were
the
nights
when
my
days
once
revolved
around
you
counting
my
footsteps
praying
the
floor
won
t
fall
through
again
and
my
mother
accused
me
of
losing
my
mind
but
i
swore
i
was
fine
you
paint
me
a
blue
sky
and
go
back
and
turn
it
to
rain
and
i
lived
in
your
chess
game
but
you
changed
the
rules
every
day
wonderin
which
version
of
you
i
might
get
on
the
phone
tonight
well
i
stopped
pickin
up
and
this
song
is
to
let
you
know
why
dear
john
i
see
it
all
now
that
you
re
gone
don
t
you
think
i
was
too
young
to
be
messed
with
the
girl
in
the
dress
cried
the
whole
way
home
i
should
ve
known
well
maybe
it
s
me
and
my
blind
optimism
to
blame
or
maybe
it
s
you
and
your
sick
need
to
give
love
then
take
it
away
and
you
ll
add
my
name
to
your
long
list
of
traitors
who
don
t
understand
and
i
look
back
in
regret
how
i
ignored
when
they
said
run
as
fast
as
you
can
dear
john
i
see
it
all
now
that
you
re

knocked
me
off

nails
on
a
chalkboard
calling
me
out
when
i
m
wounded
you
picking
on
the
weaker
man
well
you
can
take

one
single
blow

years
from
now
in
a
bar
talking
over
a
football
game
with
that
same
big
loud
opinion
but
nobody
s
listening
washed
up
and
ranting
about
the
same
old
bitter
things
drunk
and
grumbling
on
about
how
i
can
t
sing
but
all
you
are
is
mean
all
you
are
is
mean
and
a
liar
and
pathetic
and
alone
in
life
and
mean
and

and

i
used
to
think
one
day
we
d
tell
the
story
of
us
how
we
met
and
the
sparks
flew
instantly
and
people
would
say
they
re
the
lucky
ones
i
used
to
know
my
place
was
the
spot
next
to
you
now
i
m
searching
the
room
for
an
empty
seat
cause
lately
i
don
t
even
know
what
page
you
re
on
oh
a
simple
complication
miscommunications
lead
to
fall
out
so
many
things
that
i
wish
you
knew
so
many
walls
up
i
can
t
break
through
now
i
m
standing
alone
in
a
crowded
room
and
we
re
not
speaking
and
i
m
dying
to
know
is
it
killing
you
like
it
s
killing
me
yeah
i
don
t
know
what
to
say
since
the
twist
of
fate
when
it
all
broke
down
and
the
story
of
us
looks
a
lot
like
a
tragedy
now
next
chapter
how
d
we
end
up
this
way
see
me
nervously
pulling
at
my
clothes
and
trying
to
look
busy
and
you
re
doing
your
best
to
avoid
me
i
m
starting
to
think
one
day
i
ll
tell
the
story
of
us
how
i
was
losing
my
mind
when
i
saw
you
here
but
you
held
your
pride
like
you
should
ve
held
me
oh
i
m
scared
to
see
the
ending
why
are
we
pretending
this
is
nothing
i
d
tell
you
i
miss
you
but
i
don

broke
down
and
the
story
of
us
looks
a
lot
like
a
tragedy
now
this
is
looking
like
a
contest
of
who
can
act
like
they
care
less
but
i
liked
it
better
when
you
were
on
my
side
the
battle

in
your
hands
now
but
i
would
lay
my
armour
down
if
you
said
you
d
rather
love
than
fight
so
many
things
that
you
wish
i
knew
but

story
of

was
again
tonight
forcing
laughter
faking
smiles
same
old
tired
lonely
place
walls
of
insincerity
shifting
eyes
and
vacancy
vanished
when

saw
your
face

i
can
say
is
it
was
enchanting
to
meet
you
your
eyes
whispered
have
we
met
across
the
room
your
silhouette
starts
to
make
its
way
to
me
the
playful
conversation
starts
counter
all
your
quick
remarks
like
passing
notes
in
secrecy
and
it
was
enchanting
to
meet
you

i
can
say
is
i
was
enchanted
to
meet

me
up

m
pacing
back
and

would
say

first
page

where
the
story
line
ends
my
thoughts
will
echo
your
name
until
i

you

are
the
words
i

back

please
don
t
have
somebody
waiting
on
younow
go
stand
in
the
corner
and
think
about
what
you
did
time
for
a
little
revenge
the
story
starts
when
it
was
hot
and
it
was
summer
and
i
had
it
all
i
had
him
right
there
where
i
wanted
him
she
came
along
got
him
alone
and
let
s
hear
the
applause
she
took
him
faster
than
you
could
say
sabotage
i
never
saw
it
coming
wouldn
t
have
suspected
it
i
underestimated
just
who
i
was
dealing
with
she
had
to
know
the
pain
was
beating
on
me
like
a
drum
she
underestimated
just
who
she
was
stealing
from
she
s
not
a
saint
and
she
s
not
what
you
think
she
s
an
actress
she
s
better
known
for
the
things
that
she
does
on
the
mattress
soon
she
s
gonna
find
stealing
other
people
s
toys
on
the
playground
won
t
make
you
many
friends
she
should
keep
in
mind
she
should
keep
in
mind
there
is
nothing
i
do
better
than
revenge
she
looks
at
life
like
it
s
a
party
and
she
s
on
the
list
she
looks
at
me
like
i
m
a
trend
and
she
s
so
over
it
i
think
her
ever
present
frown
is
a
little
troubling
she
thinks
i
m
psycho
cause
i
like
to
rhyme
her
name
with
things
but
sophistication
isn
t
what
you
wear
or
who
you
know
or
pushing
people
down
to
get
you
where
you
wanna
go
they
wouldn
t
teach
you
that
in
prep
school
so
it
s
up
to
me
but
no
amount
of
vintage
dresses
gives
you
dignity
she
s
not
a
saint
and
she
s
not
what
you
think
she
s
an
actress
she
s
better
known
for
the
things
that
she
does
on
the
mattress
soon
she
s
gonna
find
stealing
other
people
s
toys
on
the
playground
won
t
make
you
many
friends
she
should
keep
in
mind
she
should
keep
in
mind
there
is
nothing
i
do
better
than
revenge
i
m
just
another
thing
for
you
to
roll
your
eyes
at
honey
you
might
have
him
but
haven
t
you
heard
i
m
just
another
thing
for
you
to
roll
your
eyes
at
honey
you
might
have
him
but
i
always
get
the
last
word
she
s
not
a
saint
and
she
s
not
what
you
think
she
s
an
actress
she
deserve
it
she
s
better
known
for
the
things
that
she
does
on
the

soon
she
s
gonna
find
stealing

deserve
some
applause
cause

much
better
she
took
him
faster
than
you
could
say
sabotage
i
guess
you
really
did
it
this
time
left
yourself
in
your
warpath
lost
your
balance
on
a
tightrope
lost
your
mind
tryin
to
get
it
back
wasn
t
it
easier
in
your
lunchbox
days
always
a
bigger
bed
to
crawl
into
wasn
t
it
beautiful
when
you
believed
in
everything
and
everybody
believed
in
you
it
s
alright
just
wait
and
see
your
string
of
lights
is
still
bright
to
me

you
re

some
things

of
but
at
night
you
live
it
all
again
you
wouldn
t
be
shattered
on
the
floor
now
if
only
you
had
seen
what
you
know
now
then
wasn
t
it
easier
in
your
firefly
catchin
days
when
everything
out
of
reach
someone
bigger
brought
down
to
you
wasn
t
it
beautiful
runnin
wild
til
you
fell
asleep
before
the
monsters
caught
up
to
you
it
s
alright
just
wait
and
see
your
string
of
lights
is

the
look
on
your
face
lit
through
the
darkness
at
1
58
the
words
that
you
whispered
for
just
us
to
know
you
told
me
you
loved
me
so
why
did
you
go
away
away
i
do
recall
now
the
smell
of
the
rain
fresh
on
the
pavement
i
ran
off
the
plane
that
july
9th
the
beat
of
your
heart
it
jumps
through
your
shirt
i
can
still
feel
your
arms
but
now
i
ll
go
sit
on
the
floor
wearing
your
clothes
all
that
i
know
is
i
don
t
know
how
to
be
something
you
miss
i
never
thought
we
d
have
a
last
kiss
never
imagined
we
d
end
like
this
your
name
forever
the
name
on
my
lips
i
do
remember
the
swing
of
your
step
the
life
of
the
party
you
re
showing
off
again
and
i
roll
my
eyes
and
then
you
pull
me
in
i
m
not
much
for
dancing
but
for
you
i
did
because
i
love
your
handshake
meeting
my
father
i
love
how
you
walk
with
your
hands
in
your
pockets
how
you
kissed
me
when
i
was
in
the
middle
of
saying
something
there
s
not
a
day
i
don
t
miss
those
rude
interruptions
and
i
ll
go
sit
on
the
floor
wearing
your
clothes
all
that
i
know
is
i
don
t
know
how
to
be
something
you
miss
never
thought
we
d
have
a
last
kiss
never
imagined
we
d
end
like
this
your
name
forever
the
name
on
my
lips
so
i
ll
watch
your
life
in
pictures
like
i
used
to
watch
you
sleep
and
i
feel
you
forget
me
like
i
used
to
feel
you
breathe
and
i
keep
up
with
our
old
friends
just
to
ask
them
how
you
are
hope
it
s
nice
where
you
are
and
i
hope
the
sun
shines
and
it
s
a
beautiful
day
and
something
reminds
you
you
wish
you
had
stayed
you
can
plan
for
a
change
in
weather
and
time
but
i
never
planned
on
you
changing
your
mind
so
i
ll
go
sit
on
the
floor
wearing
your
clothes
all
that
i
know
is
i
don
t
know
how
to
be
something
you
miss
never
thought
we
d
have
a
last
kiss
never
imagined
we
d
end
like
this
your
name
forever
the
name
on
my
lips
just
like
our
last
kiss
forever
the
name
on
my
lips
forever
the
name
on
my
lips
just
like
our
last
i
said
remember
this
moment
in
the
back
of
my
mind
the
time
we
stood
with
our
shaking
hands
the
crowds
in
stands
went
wild
we
were
the
kings
and
the
queens
and
they
read
off
our
names
the
night
you
danced
like
you
knew
our
lives
would
never
be
the
same
you
held
your
head
like
a
hero
on
a
history
book
page
it
was
the
end
of
a
decade
but
the
start
of
an
age
long
live
the
walls
we
crashed
through
how
the
kingdom
lights
shined
just
for
me
and
you
i
was
screaming
long
live
all
the
magic
we
made
and
bring
on
all
the
pretenders
one
day
we
will
be
remembered
i
said
remember
this
feeling
i
pass
the
pictures
around
of
all
the
years
that
we
stood
there
on
the
side
lines
wishing
for
right
now
we
are
the
kings
and
the
queens
you
traded
your
baseball
cap
for
a
crown
when
they
gave
us
our
trophies
and
we
held
them
up
for
our
town
and
the
cynics
were
outraged
screaming
this
is
absurd
cause
for
a
moment
a
band
of
thieves
in
ripped
up
jeans
got
to
rule
the
world
long
live
the
walls
we
crashed
through
how
the
kingdom
lights
shined
just
for
me
and
you
i
was
screaming
long
live
all
the
magic
we
made
and
bring
on
all
the
pretenders
i
m
not
afraid
long
live
all
the
mountains
we
moved
i
had
the
time
of
my
life
fighting
dragons
with
you
i
was
screaming
long
live
that
look
on
your
face
and
bring
on
all
the
pretenders
one
day
we
will
be
remembered
hold
on
to
spinning
around
confetti
falls
to
the
ground
may
these
memories
break
our
fall
will
you
take
a
moment
promise
me
this
that
you
ll
stand
by
me
forever
but
if
god
forbid
fate
should
step
in
and
force
us
into
a
goodbye
if
you
have
children
some
day
when
they
point
to
the
pictures
please
tell
them
my
name
tell
them
how
the
crowds
went
wild
tell
them
how
i
hope
they
shine
long
live
the
walls
we
crashed
through
i
had
the
time
of
my
life
with
you
long
long
live
the
walls
we
crashed
through
how
the
kingdom
lights
shined
just
for

and
you
and
i
was

long
live
all
the
magic
we
made
and

one
day
we
will
be
rememberedelevator
buttons
and
morning
air
strangers
silence
makes
me
wanna
take
the
stairs
if
you
were
here
we
d
laugh
about
their
vacant
stares
but
right
now
my
time
is
theirs
seems
like
there
s
always
someone
who
disapproves
they
ll
judge
it
like
they
know
about
me
and
you
and
the
verdict
comes
from
those
with
nothing
else
to
do
the
jury
s
out
but
my
choice
is
you
so
don
t
you
worry
your
pretty
little
mind
people
throw
rocks
at
things
that
shine
and
life
makes
love
look
hard
the
stakes
are
high
the
water
s
rough
but
this
love
is
ours
you
never
know
what
people
have
up
their
sleeves
ghosts
from
your
past
gonna
jump
out
at
me
lurking
in
the
shadows
with
their
lip
gloss
smiles
but
i
don
t
care
cause
right
now
you
re
mine
and
you
ll
say
don
t
you
worry
your
pretty
little
mind
people
throw
rocks
at
things
that
shine
and
life
makes
love
look
hard
the
stakes
are
high
the
water
s
rough
but
this
love
is
ours
and
it
s
not
theirs
to
speculate
if
it
s
wrong
and
your
hands
are
tough
but
they
are
where
mine
belong
and
i
ll
fight
their
doubt
and
give
you
faith
with
this
song
for
you
cause
i
love
the
gap
between
your
teeth
and
i
love
the
riddles
that
you
speak
and
any
snide
remarks
from
my
father
about
your
tattoos
will
be
ignored
cause
my
heart
is
yours
so
don
t
you
worry
your
pretty
little
mind
people
throw
rocks
at
things
that
shine
and
life
makes
love
look
hard
don
t
you
worry
your
pretty
little
mind
people
throw
rocks
at
things
that
shine
but
they
can
t
take
what
s
ours
they
can
t
take
what

ours
the
stakes
are
high
the
water
s
rough
but
this
love
is
ourslast

downi
m
walking
fast
through
the
traffic
lights
busy
streets
and
busy
lives
and
all
we
know
is
touch
and
go
we
are
alone
with
our
changing
minds
we
fall
in
love
til
it
hurts
or
bleeds
or
fades
in
time
and
i
never
never
saw
you
coming
and
i
ll
never
never
be
the
same
you
come
around
and
the
armor
falls
pierce
the
room
like
a
cannonball
now
all
we
know
is
don
t
let
go
we
are
alone
just
you
and
me
up
in
your
room
and
our
slates
are
clean
just
twin
fire
signs
four
blue
eyes
so
you
were
never
a
saint
and
i
ve
loved
in
shades
of
wrong
we
learn
to
live
with
the
pain
mosaic
broken
hearts
but
this
love
is
brave
and
wild
and
i
never
never
saw
you
coming
and
i
ll
never
never
be
the
same
this
is
a
state
of
grace
this
is
the
worthwhile
fight
love
is
a
ruthless
game
unless
you
play
it
good
and
right
these
are
the
hands
of
fate
you
re
my
achilles
heel
this
is
the
golden
age
of
something
good
and
right
and
real
and
i
never
never
saw
you
coming
and
i
ll
never
never
be
the
same
and
i
never
never
saw
you
coming
and
i
ll
never
so
you
were
never
a
saint
i
ve
loved
in
shades
of
wrong
be
the
same
we
learn
to
live
with
the
pain
mosaic
broken
hearts
but
this
love
is
brave
and
wild
this
is
a
state
of
grace
this
is
the
worthwhile
fight
love
is
a
ruthless
game
unless
you
play
it
good
and
rightloving
him
is
like
driving
a
new
maserati
down
a
dead
end
street
faster
than
the
wind
passionate
as
sin
ending
so
suddenly
loving
him
is
like
trying
to
change
your
mind
once
you
re
already
flying
through
the
free
fall
like
the
colors
in
autumn
so
bright
just
before
they
lose
it
all
losing
him
was
blue
like
i
d
never
known
missing
him
was
dark
grey
all
alone
forgetting
him
was
like
trying
to
know
somebody
you
never
met
but
loving
him
was
red
loving
him
was
red
touching
him
was
like
realizing
all
you
ever
wanted
was
right
there
in
front
of
you
memorizing
him
was
as
easy
as
knowing
all
the
words
to
your
old
favorite
song
fighting
with
him
was
like
trying
to
solve
a
crossword
and
realizing
there
s
no
right
answer
regretting
him
was
like
wishing
you
never
found
out
that
love
could
be
that
strong
losing
him
was
blue
like
i
d
never
known
missing
him
was
dark
grey
all
alone
forgetting
him
was
like
trying
to
know
somebody
you
never
met
but
loving
him
was
red
oh
red
burning
red
remembering
him
comes
in
flashbacks
and
echoes
tell
myself
it
s
time
now
gotta
let
go
but
moving
on
from
him
is
impossible
when
i
still
see
it
all
in
my
head
in
burning
red
burning
it
was
red
oh
losing
him
was
blue
like
i
d
never
known
missing
him
was
dark
grey
all
alone
forgetting
him
was
like
trying
to
know
somebody
you
never
met
cause
loving
him
was
red
yeah
yeah
red
we
re
burning
red
and
that
s
why
he
s
spinnin
round
in
my
head
comes
back
to
me
burning
red
yeah
yeah
his
love
was
like
driving
a
new
maserati
down
a
dead
end
streetput
your
lips
close
to
mine
as
long
as
they
don
t
touch
out
of
focus
eye
to
eye
till
the
gravity
s
too
much
and
i
ll
do
anything
you
say
if
you
say
it
with
your
hands
and
i
d
be
smart
to
walk
away
but
you
re
quicksand
this
slope
is
treacherous
this
path
is
reckless
this
slope
is
treacherous
and
i
i
i
like
it
i
can
t
decide
if
it
s
a
choice
getting
swept
away
i
hear
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
asking
you
to
stay
and
all
we
are
is
skin
and
bone
trained
to
get
along
forever
going
with
the
flow
but
you
re
friction
this
slope
is
treacherous
this
path
is
reckless
this
slope
is
treacherous
i
i
i
like
it
two
headlights
shine
through
the
sleepless
night
and
i
will
get
you
a
get
you
alone
your
name
has
echoed
through
my
mind
and
i
just
think
you
should
think
you
should
know
that
nothing
safe
is
worth
the
drive
and
i
would
follow
you
follow
you
home
i
ll
follow
you
follow
you
home
this
hope
is
treacherous
this
daydream
is
dangerous

house
and
you

still
got
it
in

drawer
even
now
oh
your
sweet
disposition
and
my
wide
eyed
gaze
we
re
singing
in
the
car
getting
lost
upstate
autumn
leaves
falling
down
like
pieces
into
place
and
i
can
picture
it
after
all
these
days
and
i
know
it
s
long
gone
and
that
magic
s
not
here
no
more
and
i
might
be
okay
but
i
m
not
fine
at
all
cause
there
we
are
again
on
that
little
town
street
you
almost
ran
the
red
cause
you
were
looking
over
at
me
wind
in
my
hair
i
was
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
photo
album
on
the
counter
your
cheeks
were
turning
red
you
used
to
be
a
little
kid
with
glasses
in
a
twin
sized
bed
and
your
mother
s
telling
stories
about
you
on
a
tee
ball
team
you
taught
me
bout
your
past
thinking
your
future
was
me
and
i
know
it
s
long
gone
and
there
was
nothing
else
i
could
do
and
i
forget
about
you
long
enough
to
forget
why
i
needed
to
cause
there
we
are
again
in
the
middle
of
the
night
we
re
dancing
around
the
kitchen
in
the
refrigerator
light
down
the
stairs
i
was
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
yeah
well
maybe
we
got
lost
in
translation
maybe
i
asked
for
too
much
but
maybe
this
thing
was
a
masterpiece
til
you
tore
it
all
up
running
scared
i
was
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
hey
you
call
me
up
again
just
to
break
me
like
a
promise
so
casually
cruel
in
the
name
of
being
honest
i
m
a
crumpled
up
piece
of
paper
lying
here
cause
i
remember
it
all
all
all
too
well
time
won
t
fly
it
s
like
i
m
paralyzed
by
it
i
d
like
to
be
my
old
self
again
but
i
m
still
trying
to
find
it
after
plaid
shirt
days
and
nights
when
you
made
me
your
own
now
you
mail
back
my
things
and
i
walk
home
alone
but
you
keep
my
old
scarf
from
that
very
first
week
cause
it
reminds
you
of
innocence
and
it
smells
like
me
you
can
t
get
rid
of
it
cause
you
remember
it
all
too
well
yeah
cause
there
we
are
again
when
i
loved
you
so
back
before
you
lost
the
one
real
thing

time
back
when
you
fit
in
my
poems
like
a
perfect
rhyme
took
off
faster
than
a
green
light
go
yeah
you
skipped
the
conversation
when
you
already
know
i
left
a
note
on
the
door
with
a
joke
we
d
made
and
that
was
the
first
day
and
darling
it
was
good
never
looking
down
and
right
there

like
a
girl
in
a
brand
new
dress
we
had
this
big
wide
city
all
to
ourselves
we
blocked
the
noise
with
the
sound
of
i
need
you
and
for
the
first
time
i
had
something
to
lose
and
i
guess
we
fell
apart
in
the
usual
way
and
the
story
s
got
dust
on
every
page
but
sometimes
i
wonder
how
you
think
about
it
now
and
i
see
your
face
in
every
crowd
cause

was
good
never
looking
down
and

that
baby
i
m
right
here
smile
and
it
would
ve
felt
like
a
million
little
shining
stars
had
just
aligned
and
i
would
ve
been
so
happy
christmas
lights
glisten
i
ve
got
my
eye
on
the
door
just
waiting
for
you
to
walk
in
but
the
time
is
ticking
people
ask
me
how
i
ve
been
as
i
comb
back
through
my
memory
how
you
said
you
d
be
here
you
said
you
d
be
here
and
it
was
like
slow
motion
standing
there
in
my
party
dress
in
red
lipstick
with
no
one
to
impress
and
they
re
all
laughing
as
i
m
looking
around
the
room
but
there
s
one
thing
missing
and
that
was
the
moment
i
knew
and
the
hours
pass
by
now
i
just
wanna
be
alone
but
your
close
friends
always
seem
to
know
when
there
s
something
really
wrong
so
they
follow
me
down
the
hall
and
there
in
the
bathroom
i
try
not
to
fall
apart
and
the
sinking
feeling
starts
as
i
say
hopelessly
he
said
he
d
be
here
and
it
was
like
slow
motion
standing
there
in
my
party
dress
in
red
lipstick
with
no
one
to
impress
and
they
re
all
laughing
and
asking
me
about
you
but
there
was
one
thing
missing
and
that
was
the
moment
i
knew
what
do
you
say
when
tears
are
streaming
down
your
face
in
front
of
everyone
you
know
and
what
do
you
do
when
the
one
who
means
the
most
to
you
is
the
one
who
didn
t
show
you
should
ve
been
here
and
i
would
ve
been
so
happy
and
it
was
like
slow
motion
standing
there
in
my
party
dress
in
red
lipstick
with
no
one
to
impress
and
they
re
all
standing
around
me
singing
happy
birthday
to
you
but
there
was
one
thing
missing
and
that
was
the
moment
i
knew
ooh
i
knew
ooh
you
called
me
later
and
said
i
m
sorry
i
didn
t
make
it
and
i
said
i
m
sorry
too
and
that
was
the
moment
i
knew
you
said
it
in
a
simple
way
4
am
the
second
day
how
strange
that
i
don
t
know
you
at
all
stumbled
through
the
long
goodbye
one
last
kiss
then
catch
your
flight
right
when
i
was
just
about
to
fall
i
told
myself
don
t
get
attached
but
in
my
mind
i
play
it
back
spinning
faster
than
the
plane
that
took
you
and

is

the
feeling
sinks
in

can
t
put
this
down
if
i

nonchalant
taxi
cabs
and
busy
streets
that

bring
you
back
to
me
i
can
t
help
